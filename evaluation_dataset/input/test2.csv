長榮貨機卡跑道華航緊急重飛。桃園機場又再上演飛安驚魂記，十日下午三點，一架從中國青島飛往台灣桃園機場的華航客機，準備降落前一分鐘，才被塔台通知「重飛」，原因是機場跑道一架長榮貨機還沒起飛，華航客機在準備降落的前一分鐘，塔台才緊急通知，有一架長榮貨機在跑道上還沒起飛，要求華航緊急重飛。,"China Airlines flight from Qingdao to Taiwan Taoyuan Airport experienced an emergency go-around due to a China Airlines cargo plane still on the runway. At 3 pm on the 10th, just one minute before the plane was scheduled to land, the tower notified the pilot to go-around. The reason was that a China Airlines cargo plane had not taken off from the runway yet. The tower urgently notified the pilot that there was a China Airlines cargo plane still on the runway and requested the China Airlines flight to go-around. This is another flight safety incident at Taoyuan Airport."
塔台管制員是否有疏失，飛機起降都依靠管制員的指揮，民航局堅持說都按照正常程序走，難道說造成這些飛安驚魂記，是停在跑道上還沒起飛的長榮貨機嗎？,"Did the tower controller make a mistake? The takeoff and landing of airplanes rely on the commands of the controller. The Civil Aviation Administration insists that everything followed normal procedures. Could it be that the EVA Air cargo plane, which was still on the runway and had not taken off, caused these aviation safety nightmares?"
陸委會三度烏龍傳真鄭弘儀表示沒收到。爆發粗口事件在道歉之後，主持人鄭弘儀被攻擊引用資料不實，陸委會說三度傳真都沒看到更正，鄭弘儀昨天在節目上反擊，大話新聞根本沒收到陸委會的傳真，陸委會拿出傳真的紀錄，指控鄭弘儀說謊，後來發現陸委會根本傳錯號碼。,"The Mainland Affairs Council mistakenly sent three faxes and Zheng Hongyi said she did not receive them. After the profanity incident and apology, host Zheng Hongyi was attacked for citing false information. The Mainland Affairs Council claimed they did not see any corrections after three fax attempts. Zheng Hongyi countered on the program yesterday, saying that DaHua News never received the Mainland Affairs Council's fax. The Mainland Affairs Council presented fax records and accused Zheng Hongyi of lying, but later discovered that they had sent the fax to the wrong number."
鄭弘儀在節目上全面反擊，大話新聞有準備當事人澄清專線，陸委會為什麼不call-in。,Zheng Hongyi made a comprehensive counterattack on the program. Big Talk News had prepared a clarification hotline for the parties involved. Why didn't the Mainland Affairs Council call in?
陸委會拿出在七月六日的傳真紀錄，傳真到八七九二七一零一的電話號碼，不過正確的傳真號碼應該是八七九二七一零七，差一個號碼是差很多呢。,"The Mainland Affairs Council produced a fax record from July 6th and faxed it to the phone number 87927101. However, the correct fax number should be 87927107. One digit off makes a big difference."

However, this year, due to the hot summer, fairy grass drinks have been selling well, causing a serious shortage of fairy grass products in winter. In order to provide sufficient fairy grass products in winter, the Kansai Agricultural Association is now working overtime even on holidays, boiling pots of fairy grass and smoking, while employees are busy packaging products, hoping to meet the winter demand for fairy grass."
